# Online_Book_Store-Database
Database project in SUTD, Singapore

#Django + Python Based
* This project was created in Ubuntu 14.04
* We use a low version of Django--0.96.5.
* The root path is /Sutd/Database/OnlineBookStore, where the Django environment is created. Under the root file, there are 3 files contained, one for the app `bookstore`, one for the Django env `env`, the last one `part1`, using python to create the database `try_01` and insert some books into it.
* In app `bookstore`, the `basic html` stores the fundamental html files without static files. The file `templates` has the html we would like to use in the host.

#Running Instruction
* cd Sutd/Database/OnlineBookStore
  source env/bin/activate
  cd O
